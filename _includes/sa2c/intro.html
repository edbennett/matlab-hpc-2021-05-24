  High-Performance Computing refers to the spectrum of computational
  facilities that give more power than you can fit in a typical
  desktop machine. This hands-on workshop will cover the techniques
  and tools in MATLAB that you need to effectively make use of 
  High-Performance Computing resources in your research.
